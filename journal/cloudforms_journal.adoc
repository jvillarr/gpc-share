=== Architecture

*The diagram below describes the capabilities of Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine. Its features are designed to work together to provide robust management and maintenance of your virtual infrastructure.

.Features
image:../cloudforms/architecture/cloudforms_arch1.png[]

* The architecture comprises the following components:
** The CloudForms Management Engine Appliance (Appliance) which is supplied as a secure, high-performance, preconfigured virtual machine. It provides support for Secure Socket Layer (SSL) communications.
** The CloudForms Management Engine Server (Server) resides on the Appliance. It is the software layer that communicates between the SmartProxy and the Virtual Management Database. It includes support for Secure Socket Layer (SSL) communications.
** The Virtual Management Database (VMDB) resides either on the Appliance or another computer accessible to the Appliance. It is the definitive source of intelligence collected about your Virtual Infrastructure. It also holds status information regarding Appliance tasks.
** The CloudForms Management Engine Console (Console) is the Web interface used to view and control the Server and Appliance. It is consumed through Web 2.0 mash-ups and web services (WS Management) interfaces.
** The SmartProxy can reside on the Appliance or on an ESX Server. If not embedded in the Server, the SmartProxy can be deployed from the Appliance. Each storage location must have a SmartProxy with visibility to it. The SmartProxy acts on behalf of the Appliance communicating with it over HTTPS (SSL) on standard port 443.

=== Cloudforms Appliance Allocations
==== CFME Appliance System Requirements
* POC CFME Appliance:
** 1x CFME Appliance:
*** 2 vCPU
*** 8 GB of RAM
*** 1x 40 Root Vol Disk
*** 1x 100GB DB Disk
*** 1x Network Interface

NOTE: link:../docs/Simplified-CFME-VMDB-Region-Zone-Global-Size-Estimator.ods[Simplified-CFME-VMDB-Region-Zone-Global-Size-Estimator]

=== CFME Appliance Setup
==== Initial Setup
. Download the CFME appliance from the Red Hat Customer Portal (login required). The CFME appliance is available as an OVA (Open Virtualization Format) file from: Download Software > Red Hat Enterprise Linux (v. 6 for 64-bit x86_64) > Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine (v5.2) > VMware Virtual Appliance.
. Upload the OVA file to the VMware Datastore and create the appliances virtual machines using this file. Convert the virtual machine into a template and use it to create all the appliances.

NOTE: To increase performance, increase the default 4 vCPUs/6GB RAM appliance configuration to 4 vCPUs/8GB RAM for the Web UI appliance and 4 vCPUs/8GB RAM for the DB and the Worker appliances.

==== Network Configuration
* Once started, the appliances need to be configured with basic network settings using the virtual serial console in the VMware client. Login as *admin / smartvm* and press Enter to go to the Advanced Settings menu.  Set Static Network Configuration, Set Hostname, Set Timezone, Date, and Time. When done entering the settings, select Summary Information to review.

|======================

==== Hostname Configuration
.. Select Option 4
.. Set the hostname of the CFME appliance.  Refer to the table in Network Configuration section

==== Database Configuration
* With the new appliance the Database is not shipped configured by default. There will need to be a separate Database disk created outside of the appliance and then connected once the appliance has been started. In this case, after looking at where the current VM count and number of VM's that will be coming over the next few years the Database has been sized to 100GB. This will allow for growth over the next few years.

NOTE: The database uses LVM and storage can be extended at a later time

.. On the main console window select Option 10 (To Configure Database)
.. Select 1) Internal
.. Select 1) /dev/sdb
.. Input Region *10* for the Region Selection

=== Install VMware VDDK
The integration of the VMware VDDK (Virtual Disk Development Kit) optimizes the execution of SmartState Analysis on Virtual Machines and is required for CFME Appliances to successfully collect insight information within VMware vCenter. The VDDK can be downloaded from the VMware website with a valid customer account.

. Download the VDDK 1.2.2 from VMware's website at https://my.vmware.com
. Download the file VMware-vix-disklib-5.1.1-1042608.x86_64.tar.gz
. Copy the file to the /root folder of the CFME Appliances
. Start an SSH session into the CFME Appliance
. Run the following commands to extract and install vmware vddk, accept defaults during the installation process:
----
cd /root
tar xvzf VMware-vix-disklib-5.1.1-1042608.x86_64.tar.gz
cd vmware-vix-disklib-distrib
./vmware-install.pl
----
[start=6]
. Once the VDDK is installed, run the ldconfig command in order for EVM to find the newly installed vddk library.:
----
ldconfig
----
[start=7]
. Reboot the CloudForms Appliance. The VDDK is now installed on the CFME appliance.

** Select an additional Catalog Item Resource (i.e. RHEL 6.4 - Medium)

** Repeat the previous 2 steps as many times as needed for all of the resources required for this bundle

** If needed, modify the Action Order or Provision Order:

NOTE: Provision Order will only worry about in which order it will actually provision the instance/vm.  The Action Order is done once the provisioning is completed it will then perform the action specified in that order.  Example:  You can have the same Provision Order, but only care about the order that things are powered on.
